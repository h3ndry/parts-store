TTDUC-243 - Visual representation Part's by 'UnitType'
============

## Description
As a user, I want to see a visual representation of the total UnitType's for all parts beneath the Parts List Grid component.

so that I can easily identify the ratio of Unit Types.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Implant a simple bar/pie char using a chart library (e.g., Chart.js, ngx-charts) to display the total Unit Types for all parts.
- Jasmine tests should be added
