TTDUC-319 - Create Form component(s) to add or update Parts
============

## Description
As a user, I want to add a new part or update the details of an existing part

so that I can keep track of new parts and updates to the system.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Implement an "Add Part" button with a form to add a new part using Angular Material components.
- Implement an "Edit" feature for each part in the table. When clicked, open a pre-filled form to update the part details.
- Jasmine tests should be added
